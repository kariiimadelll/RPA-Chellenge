# ðŸ¤– RPA Challenge - UiPath Automation Project

This is an automation project built using **UiPath**, designed to solve the well-known [RPA Challenge](https://rpachallenge.com/).

The challenge involves reading structured data from an Excel file, then inputting that data into a web form where the fields change order after each submission â€” a perfect test of UI automation and dynamic selectors.

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

The robot performs the following tasks:

1. Opens the RPA Challenge website.
2. Reads the data from `challenge.xlsx`.
3. Starts the challenge and dynamically identifies form fields.
4. Submits the form for each row.
